# NUMmodel_global
Here are the files needed to run the NUM model at the global scale.
This code is the one used in the article: "Linking plankton size spectra and community composition to carbon export and its efficiency" by Serra-Pompei C, Ward B, Pinti J, Visser A, Kiorboe T, and Andersen K.

The main file to run the model is: "global_npz_14.m" and to generate the plots for the article: "code_run_plots_7.m"
The run time is long (about 12 hours for 15 years using 100cores). The output files used for the article were way too large (~7GB) se we could not upload them here directy, but they can be obtained without any restriction by sending me an email (camsp@mit.edu). I will be happy to share the files.
A new version of this model is currently being developed in Fortran. This new version runs much faster and is implemented at a higher space resolution. The will be use-friendly and is aimed to be run in a laptop without the need of a Cluster. For more information contact me or my co-author Ken Andersen.
